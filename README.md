# Ersilia Model Workflows

Repository containing all the workflows to update and maintain Ersilia Models

## Background

This repository contains the necessary workflows to be called by the [eos-template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template) in sequential order. Therefore, the workflow files contained in this repository are replicated across all models in the Ersilia Model Hub. These workflows are intended to be run at model incorporation time. A detailed description of the steps to be run at model incorporation time can be found [here](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template/README.md).

Note that workflows in the current repository **cannot be run directly from the Actions panel**. This is simply a directory of workflows to be run from each model repository individually.
