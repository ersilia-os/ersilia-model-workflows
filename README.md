# Ersilia Model Workflows

Repository containing all the workflows to update and maintain the models in the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia).

## Background

This repository contains reusable workflows that are called by the workflows present in each model repository, as specified in the [eos-template](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos-template). These workflows are intended to be run at model incorporation time, whenever there is a change in the model (push or PR) and during model maintenance. Note that workflows in the current repository **cannot be run directly from the Actions panel**. This is simply a directory of workflows to be run from each model repository individually.

## Workflows

Below is a high-level summary of the workflows contained in this repository.

| Step | Workflow File               | Description |
|------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | `test-model-pr.yml`         | Tests the code in the PR branch using the `ersilia test --shallow` command to ensure the new code is not breaking the model. |
| 2    | `test-model-source.yml`     | Tests the model code as available in GitHub using the `ersilia test --shallow` command and updates (a) the model metadata in Airtable, and (b) the README file of the model. |
| 3    | `upload-model-to-s3.yml`    | Uploads the model to the S3 bucket as a persistent copy and updates the Metadata file, Airtable, and README file with the following variables: directory size, environment size, and S3 URL. |
| 4    | `upload-ersilia-pack.yml`   | Builds the Docker images of the model using the FastAPI-based packaging available at [ersilia-pack](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-pack). Builds both AMD64 and ARM64 images, tagged as dev to avoid overwriting previous working images. |
| 5    | `upload-bentoml.yml`        | If the image cannot be built with ersilia-pack, defaults to BentoML images. Tries AMD64 and ARM64 builds and tags them as dev. |
| 6    | `test-model-image.yml`      | Uses `ersilia test --deep` to test development images of the model and, if successful, retags them as latest in Ersilia's [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/ersiliaos). If only one image (AMD64 or ARM64) is built successfully, only that one is tagged as latest. |
| 7    | `post-model-upload.yml`     | After dev images are retagged as latest, updates the metadata file, README, and Airtable with the Docker URL, image size, and computational performance from `test --deep`. |
| 8    | `post-to-slack.yml`         | Posts a comment on Slack when a new issue is opened in the model repository. |
| 9    | `create-new-issue.yml`      | Creates an issue when a model is updated to assign a tester. This workflow is currently unused and will only be activated during intense model refactoring or incorporation periods. |
